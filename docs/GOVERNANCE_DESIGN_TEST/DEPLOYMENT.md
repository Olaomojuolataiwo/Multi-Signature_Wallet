Deployment.md — Governance Design Test (production-grade)

Document purpose

This file is the authoritative deployment and transaction artifact record for the Governance Design Test. Each scenario in this test suite used fresh deployments of both the Vulnerable and Secure MultiSig contracts; those per-scenario deployments are listed below along with every important transaction hash observed in the test-run logs. Snapshots and receipts generated by the test harness are also enumerated.

Chain: Sepolia (chainId 11155111)
Test harness: python t01_governance_runner.py

Summary of per-scenario fresh deployments

Each scenario deployed a fresh pair of contracts (Vulnerable + Secure). Below I list the deployment transaction and resulting contract address used for the scenario, followed by the scenario’s action txs captured in the logs.
